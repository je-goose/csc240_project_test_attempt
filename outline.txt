PROJECT OUTLINE AND STRATEGY

* Overview: Construct a classification model to determine whether a given input email is SPAM or NOT SPAM

* Preliminary strategy: Use KNN clustering, by itself, no need to get super fancy. Look a little bit into
* how to process the data and pre-fit it for optimal results with KNN classification. Particularly dimensionality reduction.

* TO-DO:
*   Lizzy:
        1. Finish data handling library.
            * Generics for string/numerical typing?
                * Is using hyperparameters viable here?
            * FACTORY class for construction is needed
        2. Produce interface, mocks for data handling library
*   Oleg:
        1. Research on implementing KNN, test out data handling library
